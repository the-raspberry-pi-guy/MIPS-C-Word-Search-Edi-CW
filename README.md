# MIPS Assembly & C Word Search Grid Solver

This repo contains coursework for the University of Edinburgh's Introduction to Computer Systems course (Prof. Boris Grot) - in particular the 2019 cohort. 

In this work I was tasked with programming a word search grid solver, first in C and then in MIPS Assembly language. More details of the task, as well as my submissions can be found in the PDF and accompanying code. "Wraparound" was the cumulative and hardest task, involving detecting all words that matched horizontally, vertically, diagonally and wrapping around the grid.

Mark: A1 grade. Completed during Year 2, Semester 1 of my BSc Computer Science programme, in Winter 2019.
